# U.S. Traveling Guide Project 2 Website

(Created and finished around early April 2024)

My second project in a JavaScript course, where I added onto Project One website (Traveling and Vacationing Around the U.S.) by adding a feedback form on the last page that makes a user fill out the form properly. The feedback form includes first name, last name, email, phone number, options choice selection, comments and a submit button. There is also a current date function that updates every day to the current date automatically. Enjoy viewing the site.

To view the website easily and quickly without having to download files, here is a link I created to click below to an easy access in viewing my site through raw.githack.com.
